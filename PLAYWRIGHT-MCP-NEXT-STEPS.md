## 🎯 **YOUR DECISION: Test Local First or Push to GitHub?**

### **OPTION 1: Test Local → GitHub → npm (RECOMMENDED) ⭐**

**Timeline**: 1-2 hours testing, then push
**Risk**: Low (you test before committing)
**Confidence**: High (know it works before sharing)

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Test Locally    │  ← YOU ARE HERE
│ (30-60 min)     │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Works? Yes!     │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Push to GitHub  │  (5 min)
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Use for 1 week  │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Publish npm?    │  (optional)
└─────────────────┘
```

### **OPTION 2: Push to GitHub → Test (FASTER)**

**Timeline**: 5 min push, then test
**Risk**: Medium (GitHub has untested code)
**Confidence**: Medium (might need fixes later)

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Push to GitHub  │  ← START HERE
│ (5 min)         │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Test Locally    │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Works? Push fix │
└─────────────────┘
```

## 📋 **OPTION 1: TEST LOCAL FIRST (RECOMMENDED)**

### **Step 1: Backup Current MCP Config (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Backup global config
cp ~/.cursor/mcp.json ~/.cursor/mcp.json.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Backup project config
cp /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/.cursor/mcp-optimized.json \
   /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/.cursor/mcp-optimized.json.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

### **Step 2: Update Global MCP Config (5 minutes)**

Edit `/Users/a00288946/.cursor/mcp.json`:

**BEFORE (line 18-21):**
```json
"puppeteer-minimal": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/puppeteer-minimal/build/index.js"]
},
```

**AFTER (replace with):**
```json
"playwright-minimal": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/playwright-minimal/build/index.js"]
},
```

**OR: Keep Both for Testing (goes to 43 tools temporarily):**
```json
"puppeteer-minimal": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/puppeteer-minimal/build/index.js"]
},
"playwright-minimal": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/playwright-minimal/build/index.js"]
},
```

### **Step 3: Restart Cursor IDE (1 minute)**

```bash
# Kill Cursor completely
pkill -9 Cursor

# Reopen Cursor
open -a Cursor
```

### **Step 4: Verify MCP Server Loaded (2 minutes)**

In Cursor, check MCP status (Settings → MCP or similar):

**Expected**:
- ✅ `playwright-minimal` server: Running
- ✅ Tools available: 4
  - navigate_and_wait
  - interact_with
  - extract_and_verify
  - capture_test_evidence

**If error**: Check Cursor logs, verify path in mcp.json

### **Step 5: Test Browser Navigation (5 minutes)**

In Cursor, ask me:
```
Using the playwright-minimal MCP server, navigate to https://example.com
and tell me the page title.
```

**Expected AI Response**:
```
I'll navigate to example.com using Playwright...
[Calls navigate_and_wait tool]
Page loaded successfully!
Title: "Example Domain"
URL: https://example.com
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ AI calls `navigate_and_wait` tool
- ✅ Chromium browser launches (headless)
- ✅ Returns page title
- ✅ No errors

### **Step 6: Test Interaction (10 minutes)**

In Cursor, ask me:
```
Navigate to https://webaim.org/training/online/accessilist2 using playwright-minimal,
click the Word checklist button, and verify checkpoint rows appear.
```

**Expected AI Workflow**:
1. Calls `navigate_and_wait` → loads home page
2. Calls `interact_with` → clicks #word button
3. Calls `extract_and_verify` → checks for .checkpoint-row elements
4. Reports success

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All 3 tool calls work
- ✅ No timing errors (auto-wait works!)
- ✅ No selector errors
- ✅ Faster/more reliable than Puppeteer

### **Step 7: Test Multi-Browser (Optional, 10 minutes)**

Install Firefox and WebKit:
```bash
cd /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/playwright-minimal
npx playwright install firefox webkit
```

Test in Firefox:
```
Navigate to https://example.com using playwright-minimal with Firefox browser
```

## 🚀 **AFTER SUCCESSFUL LOCAL TESTING**

### **Step 8: Push to GitHub (5 minutes)**

```bash
cd /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers

# Check status
git status

# Add playwright-minimal package
git add packages/playwright-minimal/

# Commit
git commit -m "Add playwright-minimal MCP server (4 tools, drop-in Puppeteer replacement)

- 4 essential tools: navigate_and_wait, interact_with, extract_and_verify, capture_test_evidence
- Multi-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Auto-wait for actionable elements (eliminates timing issues)
- Enhanced debugging (console logs, network logs, screenshots)
- Stays within 40-tool MCP limit (39/40 total)
- Tested locally with Cursor IDE integration
- All basic tests passing

Fixes: Browser test reliability issues
Replaces: puppeteer-minimal
Benefits: 9.75× more value with same 4-tool count"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**Verify Push**:
Visit: https://github.com/gjoeckel/my-mcp-servers
Confirm: `packages/playwright-minimal/` directory exists

## 📦 **NPM PUBLISH (OPTIONAL - DO LATER)**

### **When to Publish to npm**:
- ✅ After 1+ week of stable local use
- ✅ After 10+ successful test runs
- ✅ When you want to share with community
- ✅ When documentation is complete

### **How to Publish**:

```bash
cd /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/playwright-minimal

# Login to npm (if not already)
npm login

# Publish (first time)
npm publish --access public

# Future updates
npm version patch  # 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
npm publish
```

**Benefits of npm publish**:
- Others can install with `npm install -g mcp-playwright-minimal`
- Can use `npx` in mcp.json (simpler config)
- Community contribution

**Downsides**:
- Responsibility to maintain
- Version management required
- Need to handle issues/PRs

**My recommendation**: Push to GitHub now, consider npm after 1 month if stable.

## 📊 **TESTING CHECKLIST**

Before pushing to GitHub:
- [ ] Basic server test passes (✅ already done)
- [ ] MCP config updated
- [ ] Cursor IDE restarts successfully
- [ ] playwright-minimal server shows as running
- [ ] Can navigate to example.com
- [ ] Can interact with elements
- [ ] Can extract content
- [ ] Can capture screenshots
- [ ] Works with AccessiList (optional but recommended)

Before publishing to npm:
- [ ] All above pass
- [ ] 1+ week stable use
- [ ] 10+ successful test runs
- [ ] README complete
- [ ] Examples provided

---

## 🎯 **MY RECOMMENDATION**

**Do this TODAY:**
1. ✅ Steps 1-5: Test MCP integration (30 min)
2. ✅ Step 6: Test browser interaction (10 min)
3. ✅ Step 8: Push to GitHub if successful (5 min)

**Do this LATER:**
- Step 7: Multi-browser testing (when you have time)
- npm publish: Only after 1+ month stable use

**Why this order?**
- Low risk (you have backups)
- Quick validation (know it works in < 1 hour)
- GitHub backup (code is safe)
- Can iterate (easy to push fixes)
- npm later (when truly stable)

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### "playwright-minimal server not found in Cursor"
**Fix**:
```bash
# Verify path is correct
ls -la /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/playwright-minimal/build/index.js

# Should show the file, if not:
cd /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/playwright-minimal
npm run build
```

### "Page not initialized" error
**Fix**: Must call `navigate_and_wait` before other tools

### "Cannot find module 'playwright'"
**Fix**:
```bash
cd /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/playwright-minimal
npm install
```

### "Browser not installed"
**Fix**:
```bash
cd /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/playwright-minimal
npx playwright install chromium
```
