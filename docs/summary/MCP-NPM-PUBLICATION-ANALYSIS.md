# MCP Server npm Publication Analysis

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Question**: Should custom MCP servers be published to npm?

---

## 📊 **CURRENT PUBLICATION STATUS**

| Package | npm Name | Version | Published |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------|
| github-minimal | `mcp-github-minimal` | 1.0.1 | ✅ Yes |
| shell-minimal | `mcp-shell-minimal` | 1.0.0 | ✅ Yes |

| agent-autonomy | `mcp-agent-autonomy` | 1.0.1 | ✅ Yes |

**Repository**: https://github.com/gjoeckel/my-mcp-servers

### **NOT Published** ❌

| Package | Status | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| playwright-minimal | ❌ Not on npm | Just created Oct 21, 2025 |
| puppeteer-minimal | ❌ Not needed | Replaced by playwright-minimal |

---

## 💡 **DISCOVERY: YOU'RE ALREADY USING NPM PATTERN**

You've already published 5 custom MCP servers to npm! This means you have:
- ✅ npm account set up
- ✅ Publication workflow established
- ✅ Package naming convention (`mcp-*`)
- ✅ Repository linked to packages

**Current pattern**:
```json
{
  "name": "mcp-github-minimal",
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "author": "gjoeckel",
  "repository": "https://github.com/gjoeckel/my-mcp-servers.git"
}
```

## 🤔 **SHOULD PLAYWRIGHT-MINIMAL BE PUBLISHED?**

### **OPTION A: Publish to npm** ✅ (Recommended - For Consistency)

**Pros**:
1. ✅ **Consistency** - Matches your existing 5 packages
2. ✅ **Easier config** - Use `npx` instead of absolute paths
3. ✅ **Portable** - Config works on any machine
4. ✅ **Versioned** - Track changes with semver
5. ✅ **Discoverable** - Others can find and use it
6. ✅ **Shareable** - Contribute to MCP ecosystem

**Cons**:
1. ❌ **Maintenance** - Need to publish updates
2. ❌ **Public** - Code is visible (unless scoped private)

**Config becomes**:
```json
{
  "playwright-minimal": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-playwright-minimal"]
  }
}
```

**Much cleaner!** No absolute paths needed.

### **OPTION B: Keep Local Only**

**Pros**:
1. ✅ **Private** - Not published publicly
2. ✅ **Fast iteration** - No publish step

**Cons**:
1. ❌ **Inconsistent** - Other 5 are on npm
2. ❌ **Absolute paths** - Config tied to machine
3. ❌ **Manual updates** - Copy files to global location

**Current config** (requires absolute path):
```json
{
  "playwright-minimal": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/Users/a00288946/cursor-global/mcp-servers/playwright-minimal/build/index.js"]
  }
}
```

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION: PUBLISH TO NPM**

**Reasons**:
1. **You already have 5/6 published** - maintain consistency
2. **Cleaner config** - Use `npx` like filesystem/memory
3. **Portable** - Works on any machine without path changes
4. **Community value** - Your playwright-minimal is better than existing ones
5. **Easy rollback** - Can unpublish if needed

---

## 📦 **HOW TO PUBLISH PLAYWRIGHT-MINIMAL**

### **Step 1: Prepare package.json**

```bash
cd ~/cursor-global/mcp-servers/playwright-minimal
```

Edit `package.json` to match your pattern:
```json
{
  "name": "mcp-playwright-minimal",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Playwright MCP Server with minimal tool set (4 essential tools, multi-browser)",
  "author": "gjoeckel",
  "license": "MIT",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/gjoeckel/my-mcp-servers.git",
    "directory": "packages/playwright-minimal"
  },
  "keywords": ["mcp", "playwright", "browser", "automation", "testing"],
  "main": "build/index.js",
  "bin": {
    "mcp-playwright-minimal": "build/index.js"
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: Publish**

```bash
# Login (if not already)
npm login

# Publish
npm publish

# Verify
npm view mcp-playwright-minimal
```

### **Step 3: Update Configs**

**~/.cursor/mcp.json**:
```json
{
  "playwright-minimal": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-playwright-minimal"]
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No absolute paths
- ✅ Works on any machine
- ✅ Auto-updates with `-y` flag

---

## 📋 **COMPARISON: ALL CONFIGS**

### **Current** (Inconsistent):
```json
{
  "github-minimal": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mcp-github-minimal"] },
  "shell-minimal": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mcp-shell-minimal"] },
  "playwright-minimal": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/Users/a00288946/cursor-global/mcp-servers/playwright-minimal/build/index.js"]
  },
  "filesystem": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"] },
  "memory": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"] }
}
```

**Problem**: ❌ playwright-minimal uses absolute path, others use npx

### **After Publishing** (Consistent):
```json
{
  "github-minimal": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mcp-github-minimal"] },
  "shell-minimal": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mcp-shell-minimal"] },
  "playwright-minimal": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mcp-playwright-minimal"] },
  "filesystem": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"] },
  "memory": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"] }
}
```

**Result**: ✅ All use `npx`, fully portable!

## 🗂️ **WHAT ABOUT THE `my-mcp-servers` DIRECTORY?**

### **Current Structure**:
```
accessilist/
└── my-mcp-servers/
    ├── README.md          ← Documentation
    ├── package.json       ← Monorepo config
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── scripts/
    │   ├── build-all.sh   ← Build all packages
    │   ├── test-all.sh    ← Test all packages
    │   └── link-all.sh    ← Link for development
    └── packages/          ← SOURCE CODE
        ├── playwright-minimal/
        ├── github-minimal/
        ├── shell-minimal/
        ├── sequential-thinking-minimal/
        ├── everything-minimal/
        └── agent-autonomy/
```

### **Should it be deleted?** ❌ **NO!**

**Reasons to Keep**:
1. ✅ **Source of truth** - Development happens here
2. ✅ **Version control** - Git tracks changes
3. ✅ **Documentation** - README explains architecture
4. ✅ **Build scripts** - Automated building/testing
5. ✅ **GitHub repo** - Links to https://github.com/gjoeckel/my-mcp-servers

### **Workflow**:
```
1. DEVELOP in project:
   /Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/playwright-minimal/

2. BUILD:
   npm run build

3. PUBLISH to npm:
   npm publish

4. USE globally:
   npx mcp-playwright-minimal
```

**No need for ~/cursor-global/mcp-servers/ if using npm!**

## 🔄 **REVISED ARCHITECTURE** (If Published)

### **Development** (Source):
```
/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/
└── packages/
    └── playwright-minimal/
        ├── src/index.ts      ← Edit here
        ├── package.json
        └── build/            ← npm run build
```

### **Distribution** (npm):
```
npm registry
└── mcp-playwright-minimal@1.0.0
```

### **Runtime** (Cursor):
```
~/.cursor/mcp.json
└── "playwright-minimal": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-playwright-minimal"]
    }
```

**Flow**: Develop → Build → Publish → Cursor fetches from npm

---

## 🎯 **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

### **DO THIS**:

1. ✅ **Publish playwright-minimal to npm** (for consistency)
2. ✅ **Keep my-mcp-servers directory** (source code)
3. ✅ **Remove ~/cursor-global/mcp-servers/** (not needed if using npm)
4. ✅ **Update configs to use npx** (like your other 5 packages)

### **DON'T DO THIS**:
1. ❌ Delete my-mcp-servers (you need the source!)
2. ❌ Keep absolute paths in config (defeats portability)
3. ❌ Maintain two separate copies (npm + global)

---

## 📊 **COMPARISON TABLE**

| Approach | Portable? | Consistent? | Maintenance | Setup Complexity |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **5 on npm + 1 local** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ⚠️ Mixed | ⚠️ Complex |
| **All 6 on npm** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Simple | ✅ Simple |
| **All 6 local only** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Manual copies | ⚠️ Absolute paths |

**Winner**: **All 6 on npm** ✅

---

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. **Sync source to monorepo**:
   ```bash
   cp -r ~/cursor-global/mcp-servers/playwright-minimal \
         /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/
   ```

2. **Publish to npm**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/a00288946/Projects/accessilist/my-mcp-servers/packages/playwright-minimal
   npm publish
   ```

3. **Update configs to use npx**:
   ```json
   "playwright-minimal": {
     "command": "npx",
     "args": ["-y", "mcp-playwright-minimal"]
   }
   ```

4. **Remove global copy** (no longer needed):
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/cursor-global/mcp-servers/
   ```

5. **Restart Cursor**:
   ```bash
   pkill -9 Cursor && open -a Cursor
   ```

---

**Result**: Fully consistent, portable, npm-based MCP server architecture! 🎉
