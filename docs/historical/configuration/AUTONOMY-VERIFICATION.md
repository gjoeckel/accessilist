# Autonomy Verification

- This file documents current and possible autonomous capabilities of MCP tools used in this Cursor IDE environment, plus needed updates and recommendations.
- Date: 2025-10-06

## Understanding
- You want a high-level yet complete view of all available MCP tools, what they can do autonomously today, what additional autonomy is possible, and concrete update steps.
- You also asked to include recommendations based on this review.

If any tool naming or scope differs from your intended configuration, I can adjust quickly.

### MCP Health Check (2025-10-06)

Notes
- Filesystem/Memory tools are fully autonomous today (used for file creation and edits).
- GitHub minimal tools are now fully autonomous with `GITHUB_TOKEN` configured and working.
- Puppeteer minimal is available; UI tests executed via Playwright runner; MCP browser tools can be integrated into the same flow.
- Sequential-thinking and Everything minimal tools are available; not yet wired into routine CI flows here.
- Tool count optimized to 39 tools (under 40-tool limit) for optimal performance.

## Needed Updates

- `mcp_github-minimal_*`
  1. âœ… RESOLVED - GitHub token configured and working
     - `GITHUB_TOKEN` set in environment via `.zshrc` and `.env` files
     - GitHub MCP server running with full functionality
     - Repository operations now fully autonomous
  2. âœ… COMPLETED - All autonomy steps implemented
     - `GITHUB_TOKEN` exported in shell profile (`.zshrc`)
     - MCP servers verified via `scripts/verify-mcp-autonomous.sh`
     - Ready for GitHub Actions workflow implementation

- `mcp_puppeteer-minimal_*`
  1. Current autonomy needing optimization
     - UI tests run via Playwright JS suite, not MCP tools; duplication of capabilities.
  2. Steps to enable possible autonomy
     - Create a thin test harness that calls `mcp_puppeteer_*` tools for navigate/screenshot/assert flows.
     - Unify reporting under `tests/reports/`; baseline visual diffing for regressions.

- `mcp_memory_*`
  1. Current autonomy needing optimization
     - No enforced schema or retention policy for entities/observations.
  2. Steps to enable possible autonomy
     - Define schema for entities/relations; add utilities for rollups and pruning.
     - Store last-session summary and next-steps automatically on `ai-end`.

- `mcp_filesystem_*`
  1. Current autonomy needing optimization
     - Writes are not transactional; large edits can risk partial writes.
  2. Steps to enable possible autonomy
     - Wrap edits with backups and automatic lint/format checks; policy-guard directories.

- `mcp_sequential-thinking-minimal_*`
  1. Current autonomy needing optimization
     - Not integrated into test/build flows; limited visibility.
  2. Steps to enable possible autonomy
     - Capture analysis/solution artifacts per task; link IDs to commits and reports.

- `mcp_everything-minimal_*`
  1. Current autonomy needing optimization
     - Diagnostics not scheduled; manual usage only.
  2. Steps to enable possible autonomy
     - Run protocol validation and diagnostics nightly; attach artifacts to CI.

- `mcp_shell-minimal_*`
  1. Current autonomy needing optimization
     - Guardrails not explicitly enforced in config.
  2. Steps to enable possible autonomy
     - Maintain a pre-validated command catalog and enforce allowlist; log and audit.

## Recommendations
- âœ… Keep total MCP tool count under ~40; **ACHIEVED** - 39 tools (optimized)
- âœ… Ensure MCP servers start with `ai-start` and are health-checked via `scripts/verify-mcp-autonomous.sh`; **COMPLETED**
- âœ… Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` and add a minimal CI workflow to run tests and (optional) deploy; **TOKEN SET**
- Migrate critical UI checks to `mcp_puppeteer_*` to reduce duplicated test stacks and improve observability.
- Add schema and retention to `mcp_memory_*` for durable, queryable project memory.
- Wrap file edits with safety (backup, lint, format) to prevent partial writes.
- Schedule protocol diagnostics and environment drift checks to surface issues early.
