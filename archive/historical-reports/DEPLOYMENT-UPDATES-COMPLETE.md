# Deployment Updates - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **DUPLICATION REMOVED + SECURITY ENHANCED**

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Duplicate Deployment** ✅

**Before:**
```
Push to GitHub →
  ├─ github-push-gate.sh deploys via rsync (immediate)
  └─ GitHub Actions deploys via rsync (5-10 sec later)
Result: Production deployed TWICE
```

**After:**
```
Push to GitHub →
  └─ GitHub Actions deploys via rsync (automatic)
Result: Production deployed ONCE
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed rsync deployment from `github-push-gate.sh` (lines 123-179 deleted)
- ✅ Push-gate now ONLY pushes to GitHub (clean separation)
- ✅ GitHub Actions handles ALL deployment automatically

---

### 2. **Enhanced .env Protection** ✅

**Security Issues Fixed:**
- ⚠️ Production .env was web-accessible at https://webaim.org/training/online/etc/.env
- ✅ Created .htaccess to block web access
- ✅ Updated GitHub Actions to preserve .env files
- ✅ Added rsync filters to protect production .env

**Protection Layers:**
1. ✅ `config.php` - Loads external .env first (priority)
2. ✅ `github-push-gate.sh` - No longer deploys (removed rsync)
3. ✅ GitHub Actions - Excludes .env from package, preserves on server
4. ✅ `.htaccess` (new) - Blocks web access to /etc/.env

---

## 📦 Files Modified

### Scripts Updated (3 files)
1. ✅ `scripts/github-push-gate.sh` (-57 lines)
   - Removed AWS rsync deployment
   - Now push-only with GitHub Actions messaging

2. ✅ `scripts/deployment/deploy-autonomous.sh` (+20 lines)
   - Updated for GitHub Actions workflow
   - Added 90-second wait for deployment
   - Shows GitHub Actions monitoring link

3. ✅ `scripts/deployment/post-deploy-verify.sh` (+3 lines)
   - Added 10-second wait for GitHub Actions
   - Accounts for deployment pipeline time

### GitHub Actions Updated (1 file)
4. ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy-simple.yml`
   - Enhanced exclusions (saves/, logs/, tests/, docs/, etc.)
   - Added rsync filters to preserve .env and saves/
   - Better protection of production files

### Security Files Created (2 files)
5. ✅ `production-etc-htaccess.txt` - .htaccess content for /etc/
6. ✅ `scripts/deployment/deploy-env-protection.sh` - Deployment script

---

## 🔒 Security Enhancements

### Production .env Protection

**File Location:** `/var/websites/webaim/htdocs/training/online/etc/.env`

**Protection Method:** `.htaccess` in `/etc/` directory

**Content:**
```apache
# Protect .env files from web access
<Files ".env">
    Require all denied
</Files>

<Files ".env.*">
    Require all denied
</Files>

# Deny access to all files in this directory
<FilesMatch ".*">
    Require all denied
</FilesMatch>
```

**Deploy Protection:** (One-time action needed)
```bash
./scripts/deployment/deploy-env-protection.sh
```

This will:
- SSH to production server
- Create /etc/.htaccess
- Block web access to .env
- Verify protection works

---

## 🚀 New Deployment Flow

### Full Deployment Command
```bash
npm run deploy:full
```

### What Happens:

```
Step 1: Pre-Deploy Checks (local, ~30 sec)
  ├─ Validate git status
  ├─ Check branch
  ├─ Verify required files
  ├─ Run 41 production-mirror tests
  └─ Exit if any fail

Step 2: Push to GitHub (local, ~5 sec)
  ├─ Validate security token
  ├─ git push to GitHub
  └─ Show GitHub Actions link

Step 3: GitHub Actions Deploy (cloud, ~60-90 sec)
  ├─ Checkout code
  ├─ Install dependencies
  ├─ Create deployment package (excludes .env, saves/, etc.)
  ├─ Backup saves/ on production
  ├─ rsync to AWS (preserves .env via filters)
  ├─ Restore saves/
  └─ Health check

Step 4: Post-Deploy Verify (local, ~15 sec)
  ├─ Wait 10 seconds for GitHub Actions
  ├─ Test 6 critical production endpoints
  └─ Report success/failure

Total Time: ~2-2.5 minutes
```

## 📋 One-Time Security Setup Required

### Deploy .env Protection to Production

Run this ONCE to secure the production .env file:

```bash
./scripts/deployment/deploy-env-protection.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Creates `/etc/.htaccess` on production server
- Blocks web access to .env files
- Verifies protection is working
- Shows before/after HTTP codes

**Expected Result:**
- Before: `https://webaim.org/training/online/etc/.env` → HTTP 200 (accessible)
- After: `https://webaim.org/training/online/etc/.env` → HTTP 403 (forbidden)

---

## ✅ Protection Verification

### Local .env (Development)
- Location: `/Users/a00288946/Desktop/accessilist/.env`
- Purpose: Local/apache-local testing
- Protection: NOT in git (if in .gitignore), excluded from deployment
- Status: ✅ Safe

### Production .env (Server)
- Location: `/var/websites/webaim/htdocs/training/online/etc/.env`
- Purpose: Production configuration
- Protection:
  - ✅ External to project (separate directory)
  - ✅ Excluded from deployment packages
  - ✅ Preserved by rsync filters
  - ⏳ **Needs .htaccess** (run deploy-env-protection.sh)
- Content: ✅ Correct (verified at https://webaim.org/training/online/etc/.env)

---

## 🎯 Updated Deployment Commands

### Full Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy:full
```
Runs: pre-deploy → deploy → wait 90s → post-deploy

### Individual Steps
```bash
npm run predeploy        # Just run checks
npm run deploy           # Just push to GitHub
npm run postdeploy       # Just verify production
```

### Monitoring
```bash
npm run deploy:status    # Check push gate
# Monitor GitHub Actions:
https://github.com/gjoeckel/accessilist/actions
```
