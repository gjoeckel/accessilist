## Guidelines for Writing Good User Stories

### INVEST Criteria
- **Independent:** Can be developed in any sequence
- **Negotiable:** Details are flexible and can be discussed
- **Valuable:** Provides clear value to end users
- **Estimable:** Team can estimate the effort required
- **Small:** Can be completed within one sprint
- **Testable:** Has clear acceptance criteria

### Tips
1. Focus on the user's perspective, not technical implementation
2. Keep stories small and focused on a single piece of functionality
3. Include clear acceptance criteria that can be tested
4. Separate technical notes from the user story itself
5. Use consistent formatting across all stories
6. Link related stories together when they form an epic
7. Update stories as requirements evolve

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Writing technical tasks as user stories
- Making stories too large or complex
- Vague acceptance criteria
- Mixing multiple features in one story
- Not including the "so that" benefit statement
- Forgetting about edge cases and error conditions
