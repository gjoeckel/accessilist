### 2025-10-01 17:22:51 UTC - Instantiate Endpoint for Session Creation Tracking

**Summary:**
- Added new `/php/api/instantiate.php` endpoint to record session creation timestamps
- Enhanced StateManager to automatically call instantiate endpoint during initialization
- Separates "Created" time (on instantiation) from "Updated" time (on first save)

**New API Endpoint:**
- `POST /php/api/instantiate.php`: Creates minimal placeholder file for new sessions
- Records session metadata (type, typeSlug, version) and creation timestamp
- Idempotent operation - safe to call multiple times
- Uses file mtime for Admin panel "Created" display, stores readable timestamp in metadata

**StateManager Enhancement:**
- Added `ensureInstanceExists()` method called during initialization
- Non-blocking implementation with graceful error handling
- Automatically creates backend record when checklist session starts
- Ensures Admin panel shows creation time immediately

**Technical Details:**
- Creates placeholder JSON without 'timestamp' field to keep "Updated" blank until first save
- Stores creation time in milliseconds: `round(microtime(true) * 1000)`
- Validates session key and creates saves directory if needed
- Returns standardized JSON response with success/error status

**Impact:**
- Admin panel now shows "Created" time immediately when session starts
- Better user experience with immediate feedback on session creation
- Maintains existing save/restore functionality unchanged
- Non-disruptive: fails gracefully if endpoint unavailable

**Files Modified:**

### 2025-10-01 17:03:00 UTC - API Rewrite Fixes, Image Path Normalization, Simulated Prod Test

**Summary:**
- Implemented `.htaccess` internal rewrites to support extensionless API and PHP routes while preserving HTTP methods
- Normalized image and API path usage in JS to rely on `path-utils` helpers
- Added simulated production server router and e2e validation script; all checks passed

**Server Routing Fixes:**
- `.htaccess`: Disable `MultiViews`; rewrite `php/api/{name}` → `php/api/{name}.php`, `php/{name}` → `php/{name}.php` (internal, no redirect)
- Ensures POST to `/php/api/save` is handled by `save.php` without changing method

**JavaScript Path Updates:**
- `js/path-utils.js`: `getAPIPath()` appends `.php` only for local dev when given extensionless names
- `js/StateManager.js`: Use `getAPIPath('save')` and `getAPIPath('restore')`
- `js/buildPrinciples.js`: Use `window.getImagePath(iconName)` for add-row icons (fixes missing icons)
- `js/admin.js`: Use `getPHPPath('mychecklist.php')` for links and extensionless `getAPIPath('list'|'delete')`

**Simulated Production Validation:**
- Added `tests/router.php` to emulate .htaccess behavior with PHP built-in server
- Added `tests/e2e/simulate_prod_check.sh` to start server on 8010 and run curl checks
- Validated:
  - Index redirect (302) and `/php/home` (200)
  - `.php` and extensionless API routes for `health`, `restore`, `save`
  - Image asset `/images/add-1.svg` (200)
  - Minimal save then restore returns 200
- Result: Summary 0 failures

**Docs:**
- Updated `fixes.md` statuses and next steps with implemented changes and local validation notes

**Impact:**
- Restores save/restore functionality under extensionless routing
- Fixes missing add-row icons in production paths
- Provides repeatable high-level prod-simulation test

### 2025-10-01 15:47:00 UTC - Manual Row Save/Restore Fixes + Legacy Overlay Code Removal

**Summary:**
- Fixed critical save/restore issues with manually added principle rows
- Resolved status restoration problems (completed status reverting to in-progress)
- Eliminated duplicate row restoration during page reload
- Removed all legacy text overlay code from JavaScript and CSS
- Achieved complete separation of Report table functionality to dedicated page

**Manual Row Save/Restore Fixes:**
- **Status Restoration Issue**: Fixed completed status reverting to "in-progress" on restore
  - **Root Cause**: `renderSinglePrincipleRow` method only created DOM but didn't apply saved status state
  - **Solution**: Added `applyCompletedStateToRow` method to properly restore completed status
  - **Result**: Completed rows now maintain proper status, restart button visibility, and textarea disabled state
- **Duplicate Row Issue**: Fixed rows being restored twice during page reload
  - **Root Cause**: `restorePrincipleRowsState` called multiple times without checking for existing rows
  - **Solution**: Added duplicate detection in both `restorePrincipleRowsState` and `renderSinglePrincipleRow`
  - **Result**: Each manual row restored exactly once, no duplicates
- **Missing Attributes**: Fixed status and restart buttons missing `data-id` attributes
  - **Solution**: Added proper `data-id` attributes in `createTableRow` function
  - **Result**: Event handling works correctly for restored rows

**Legacy Overlay Code Removal:**
- **Complete Cleanup**: Removed all text overlay functionality (legacy and unused)
- **JavaScript Files Cleaned**:
  - `js/StateManager.js`: Removed overlay creation/removal code in `applyCompletedTextareaState` and `resetTask`
  - `js/StateEvents.js`: Removed overlay creation/restoration code in textarea state methods
- **CSS Files Cleaned**:
  - `css/form-elements.css`: Removed `.notes-text-overlay`, `.report-task-text-overlay`, `.report-notes-text-overlay` styles
  - `css/table.css`: Removed report overlay styles
  - Rebuilt all compiled CSS files to remove overlay references
- **Validation**: Confirmed zero remaining references to overlay classes across entire codebase
- **Impact**: Cleaner DOM, reduced complexity, eliminated redundant overlay elements

**Report Table Separation (Completed):**
- **Architecture Change**: Moved Report table from `mychecklist.php` to dedicated `reports.php` page
- **Navigation Updated**: Report link now points to `reports.php` instead of `#report`
- **State Management Simplified**: Removed all report row save/restore logic from main checklist
- **Separation of Concerns**: Checklist handles principles, Reports page handles report generation
- **Result**: Eliminated save/restore conflicts between report and principle rows

**Technical Improvements:**
- **New Method**: `applyCompletedTextareaStateForRestore` - applies completed styling without creating overlays
- **Enhanced Validation**: Added duplicate row detection in restore process
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved logging and error messages for restore operations
- **Code Quality**: Removed 200+ lines of legacy overlay code across JavaScript and CSS

**Files Modified:**

- Eliminated 369 lines of code duplication across JavaScript and CSS
- Created centralized date formatting utilities
- Fixed Admin page Updated timestamp logic
- Applied user preference: line-height: 2 for all multiline text
- Added visual row type differentiation (manual vs automatic)

**Report Row DRY Refactoring (JavaScript):**
- **3 Pathways Unified** → Single StateManager entry point:
  - Manual row addition (Add Row button)
  - Automatic row addition (task completion)
  - State restoration (page reload)
- **New StateManager Methods** (+103 lines):
  - `createReportRowData()` - Standardizes row data structure
  - `addReportRow()` - Single entry point for all additions
  - `renderSingleReportRow()` - Efficient single-row DOM rendering
- **Refactored Files**:
  - `js/addRow.js` (67 → 30 lines, -37 lines): Now delegates to StateManager
  - `js/StateEvents.js` (-22 lines): Removed event-based coupling, direct StateManager calls
  - `js/buildReport.js` (-20 lines): Removed taskCompleted event listener
- **Property Name Standardization**: All code now uses 'task' (singular) consistently
- **Event Architecture Replaced**: Direct method calls replace loose event coupling
- **Impact**: -40 lines net, ~120 lines duplication eliminated, clearer data flow

**Date Utilities (NEW: js/date-utils.js):**
- **Single Source of Truth** for all date formatting:
  - `formatDateShort()` → "MM-DD-YY" (e.g., "10-02-25")
  - `formatDateAdmin()` → "MM-DD-YY HH:MM AM/PM"
  - `formatDateLong()` → Full date/time for tooltips
- **Updated 7 Files** to use unified formatters:
  - `js/addRow.js`, `js/StateEvents.js`, `js/StateManager.js`
  - `js/admin.js`, `php/admin.php`, `php/mychecklist.php`
- **Eliminated** 5 duplicate date formatting implementations
- **Impact**: All timestamps now consistently formatted across app

**Admin "Updated" Column Fix:**
- **Behavior Changed**:
  - New instances → Updated shows "—" (not yet saved)
  - First save → Updated shows timestamp
  - Each save → Updated timestamp updates
  - Reset/Delete operations → Triggers auto-save, updates timestamp
- **Files Modified**:
  - `php/api/list.php` - Only include lastModified if timestamp exists
  - `js/admin.js` - Conditional display logic
  - `php/admin.php` - Embedded admin code updated
- **Impact**: Accurate "last modified" tracking, clear visual indicator

**CSS DRY Consolidation:**
- **Unified Selectors** (css/form-elements.css):
  - Textareas: 3 definitions → 1 multi-selector (-42 lines)
  - Notes Cells: 3 definitions → 1 multi-selector (-30 lines)
  - Text Overlays: 5 definitions → 1 multi-selector (-25 lines)
- **User Preference Applied**: line-height: 2 for all multiline text
  - Applied to all textareas (notes, tasks in principles & report tables)
  - Applied to all text overlays
  - Consistent reading experience throughout app
- **Impact**: -97 lines CSS duplication, single source of truth

**Row Type Differentiation:**
- **Added CSS Classes** to Report rows:
  - Manual rows: `class="report-row manual"`
  - Automatic rows: `class="report-row automatic"`
- **Enables** future visual styling to distinguish row types
- **Improves** debugging and user clarity

**Combined Metrics:**
- **Total Files Modified**: 13
- **Total Files Created**: 2 (date-utils.js, report-row-dry-analysis.md)
- **Net Code Reduction**: -137 lines
- **Duplication Eliminated**: -369 lines across JavaScript and CSS
- **New Features**: Date utilities, row type classes, accurate timestamps
- **User Preferences**: line-height: 2 applied throughout

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for row creation and date formatting

### 2025-10-01 11:38:13 UTC - Save/Restore System Refactor Complete + Modal Callback Fix

**Summary:**
- Completed comprehensive refactoring of save/restore system consolidating 7 legacy modules into 3 unified ES6 modules
- Fixed critical modal manager bug preventing reset and delete operations from executing
- Reduced code duplication from 84% to minimal levels through centralized state management
- Implemented unified event delegation system replacing scattered event handlers across multiple files

**Save/Restore System Refactor:**
- **New Unified Modules** (3 files replacing 7):
  - `StateManager.js` (828 lines) - Unified session management, state collection/restoration, API communication, orchestration
  - `ModalActions.js` (113 lines) - Centralized modal confirmation logic for reset/delete operations
  - `StateEvents.js` (516 lines) - Global event delegation for all UI interactions (clicks, inputs, status changes)

### 2025-09-30 00:00:00 UTC - Startup Tokens Implemented, Legacy Cleanup, Health Endpoint

**Summary:**
- Replaced legacy "follow rules" with three startup tokens: quick, new, full
- Added `scripts/startup-runbook.sh` with `--require-mcp` and `--no-chrome` flags
- Implemented minimal health endpoint `php/api/health.php`
- Added optional MCP health verification hook and test stub
- Updated docs (`README.md`, `best-practices.md`) and rules to reflect new flow
- Removed legacy `scripts/follow-rules.sh`

**Details:**
- `scripts/startup-runbook.sh`: modes (quick/new/full), readiness + health checks, report output
- Flags: `--minimal`, `--require-mcp`, `--no-chrome`
- `tests/chrome-mcp/health_check.php`: curl-based stub asserting `{ status: "ok" }`
- `.cursor/rules/always.md`: new tokens documented, legacy flow deprecated
- Docs updated to reference startup tokens instead of legacy wrapper

**Impact:**
- Faster, SRD-aligned startup with constrained resource usage by default
- Stricter optional MCP enforcement for `new`/`full`
- Cleaner codebase with legacy process removed

### 2025-09-30 17:09:31 UTC - Report Table Completed Status: Full Save/Restore with DRY Styling

**Summary:**
- Implemented completed status handling for Report table with both Tasks and Notes columns becoming inactive
- Fixed Report table save/restore functionality with proper state management
- Applied DRY principles to Report table button styling (matching Checklist and Admin styles)
- Fixed duplicate row addition bug and added proper event delegation for Report table

**Completed Status UI (A, B, C Requirements):**
- **A. Border Hidden**: Both Task and Notes textarea borders set to `none` when status = completed
- **B. Non-Interactive**: Both textareas disabled with `pointer-events: none` and `disabled = true`
- **C. Top-Aligned**: Text overlays use `display: block` (not `flex` with `align-items: center`)

**Report Table Save/Restore:**
- **State Collection**: Extended to capture `.report-task-textarea` and `.report-notes-textarea` values
- **Status Buttons**: Collects both `.status-button` (Principles) and `.report-status-button` (Report)
- **Report Rows**: Initialized `window.reportTableState.rows` to track manual Report rows
- **Restoration**: Added `window.renderReportTable()` to recreate rows from saved state
- **Completed State**: Automatically applies inactive state to both columns when status = completed

**Event Delegation Enhancements:**
- **Status Button Clicks**: Added event delegation for `.report-status-button` clicks
- **Textarea Input**: Auto-updates status from pending → in-progress when Notes textarea gets input
- **State Tracking**: Updates `window.reportTableState` when textareas change or status changes
- **Notes-Only Trigger**: Only Notes textarea triggers status change (Tasks can be added first)

**DRY Button Styling:**
- **Status Buttons**: Report status buttons now 75x75 (same as Checklist status buttons)
- **Delete Buttons**: Report delete buttons now 70x70 (same as Admin delete buttons)
- **Removed Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate CSS definitions for Report buttons
- **Consistent Positioning**: Both use `position: absolute` with `margin: auto` centering

**Bug Fixes:**
- **Duplicate Rows**: Removed duplicate event listener in `buildReport.js` (was adding 2 rows)
- **Missing Script**: Added `addRow.js` to `mychecklist.php` script includes
- **Global Functions**: Exposed `createTableRow` and `handleAddRow` as window globals
- **Report State Init**: Initialized `window.reportTableState` in `main.js`

**Files Modified:**
- `js/state-restorer.js` - Added Report table detection and both-column inactive state handling
- `js/state-collector.js` - Extended to collect Report table textareas and status buttons
- `js/main.js` - Added Report table event delegation, state management, and renderReportTable()
- `js/addRow.js` - Added row to window.reportTableState, exposed createTableRow globally

- `php/mychecklist.php` - Added addRow.js script include
- `css/table.css` - Applied DRY styling to Report buttons, removed duplicates
- `css/form-elements.css` - Fixed overlay top-alignment (display: block)

**User Experience:**
1. User adds manual Report row with Tasks and Notes text
2. When Notes text is entered, status auto-updates to In Progress
3. User clicks status button to mark as Completed
4. BOTH Tasks and Notes columns become inactive (borders hidden, non-interactive, top-aligned)
5. All state saved correctly with session
6. On restore, Report row recreated with completed state fully preserved

**Impact:**
- Report table now has feature parity with Principles tables for completed status
- DRY button styling ensures visual consistency across all tables
- Complete save/restore support for Report table manual rows

- `js/save-restore-orchestrator.js` - Added minimum loading time enforcement and session-based overlay control
- `js/save-restore-api.js` - Changed restoration to synchronous (no async needed)
- `js/main.js` - Modified to preserve overlay when session key present
- `php/mychecklist.php` - Updated overlay opacity to 90%

**Technical Details:**
- **Instant Jump Method**: Uses `window.scrollTo(0, section.offsetTop)` for immediate positioning
- **Minimum Display Time**: Calculates elapsed time and enforces 2-second minimum before hiding overlay
- **Session-Aware Overlay**: Only shows loading overlay when URL contains session parameter
- **Synchronous Restoration**: Removed async/await complexity from state restoration process

**User Experience:**
1. Page loads with loading overlay visible (90% opaque white)
2. Behind overlay, page instantly jumps to saved section (e.g., Reports)
3. All UI state restored (notes, status buttons, side panel highlighting)
4. After minimum 2 seconds, overlay fades revealing fully restored page
5. User sees their work exactly as they left it, no manual navigation needed

**Impact:**
- Eliminated timing issues between scrolling animation and overlay dismissal
- Provided smooth, controlled restoration experience with visual feedback
- Simplified codebase by removing complex async scrolling coordination
- Maintained clean URL structure (no hash fragments)
- Improved reliability and user experience during session restoration

- Standardized asset path usage in `js/addRow.js` and `js/main.js` to `window.get*Path(...)`.
- Updated tests to reference `path-utils.js` instead of `path-config.js`.
- Added width/height attributes for consistent sizing (no layout change):
  - Side panel icons 36x36 in `php/mychecklist.php`
  - Status/delete icons 24x24 in `js/addRow.js`

**Rationale:**
- Simplify and DRY path resolution, reduce load-order dependencies, and stabilize image layout per MVP rules.

**Files Removed:**
- `js/path-config.js`

**Files Modified:**
- `js/addRow.js`
- `js/main.js`
- `php/mychecklist.php`
- `test-asset-paths.js`
- `test-production-paths.html`
- `test-path-configuration.html`
- `test-production-assets.sh`

**Validation:**
- Local PHP server on port 8000 returns 200 for `/php/home.php`.
- Browser loads images and JSON via standardized helpers.

### 2025-09-22 23:31:04 UTC - Add path-utils and wire into PHP pages

### 2025-09-22 15:26:40 UTC - Fix broken image paths causing 404 errors

**Issue:**
- 29 broken images identified via browser console diagnostics
- Inconsistent image path patterns across JavaScript files
- Some files used `/images/` (404 errors) while others used `/training/online/accessilist/images/` (working)

**Solution:**
- Standardized all image paths to use consistent `/training/online/accessilist/images/` pattern
- Fixed image references in buildPrinciples.js, save-restore.js, and admin.js
- All images now load correctly without 404 errors

**Files Modified:**
- `js/buildPrinciples.js`: Fixed number icons and info icons (6 paths)
- `js/save-restore.js`: Fixed status icons (1 path)  
- `js/admin.js`: Fixed delete icon (1 path)

**Technical Details:**
- Used browser diagnostic script to identify exact broken paths
- Verified working path pattern through systematic testing
- Applied consistent path pattern across all JavaScript files
