## Entries

### 2025-10-07 16:52:43 UTC - Scroll offset fix + Footer message improvements

**Summary:**
- Fixed section scroll positioning (sections were scrolling 165px too high)
- Updated footer status messages for better clarity and visibility

**Changes:**
- `js/StateManager.js`: 
  - `jumpToSection()` offset changed from 90px to 255px (230px header + 25px padding) to align with side panel viewing area
  - Footer messages now persist for 5 seconds (up from 3 seconds)
  - Removed periods from success messages: "Saved at 10:30 AM" and "Restored using KEY"
  - Fixed spacing in "Restored using" message

**Root Cause:**
- Side panel navigation starts at 230px from viewport top
- Previous offset only accounted for 70px header + 20px padding = 90px
- Difference of 165px caused sections to scroll under UI elements

**Validation:**
- Sections now scroll to correct position aligned with side panel
- Footer messages display cleanly without trailing punctuation
- Messages remain visible for 5 seconds for comfortable reading

### 2025-10-07 22:44:37 UTC - Section padding + Scroll offset; Footer message tweaks

**Summary:**
- Reduced section padding to 20px and aligned scroll offsets with sticky header
- Footer status bubble: no icons; color-coded success/error; WCAG announcements with bold key

**Changes:**
- `css/section.css`, `css/admin.css`: `padding-top: 20px`
- `js/StateManager.js`: adjusted `jumpToSection` offset; messages (Saved/Restored/Error) per spec
- `css/status.css`: right-aligned bubble; `:empty` hide; success `#478F00`, error `#BF1712`
- `js/StatusManager.js`: supports Node fragments; type-based classes

**Validation:**
- Verified scroll alignment and message visibility in Docker environment


### 2025-10-07 22:33:20 UTC - WCAG Footer Status + Admin typeSlug alignment

**Summary:**
- Added WCAG-compliant footer announcements for Save and Restore
- Right-aligned, rounded, white bubble hidden when empty
- Admin page renders Type from `typeSlug`; API paths standardized
- Production `.env` externalized (`/training/online/etc/.env`) and protected from deploys

**Changes:**
- `js/StatusManager.js`: announce() supports Nodes; back-compat showMessage
- `js/StateManager.js`: Save → “Saved at HH:MM.”, Restore → “Restored using key <strong>KEY</strong>.”
- `css/status.css`: bubble styling, `:empty` auto-hide, right alignment
- `php/admin.php`: use `getAPIPath('list'|'delete')`, display via `typeSlug`
- `php/api/list.php`: normalize missing `typeSlug` from legacy `type`
- `php/includes/config.php`: prefer external etc/.env then project .env
- `github-push-gate.sh`: protect `.env` via rsync filter

**Validation:**
- Docker parity server: routes OK, save/restore OK, footer announces messages
- Production: Admin list shows correct Types; external .env read


### 2025-10-07 21:44:17 UTC - Docker Parity Server + Route & Save/Restore Validation

**Summary:**
- Added Docker Compose php:8.1-apache service with `mod_rewrite` and `AllowOverride All` (port 8080)

**Validation:**
- Routes: `/home`, `/admin`, `/php/api/list` → 200 OK
- API lifecycle: `instantiate` → `save` → `restore` → `list` → `delete` → all succeeded (`typeSlug=word`, `sessionKey=TST`)


### 2025-10-07 20:55:00 UTC - Scalability & Admin Type Column Fixes

**Summary:**
- Fixed Admin page Type column display (JavaScript loading race condition)
- Implemented server-side key generation for 100+ concurrent users
- Added atomic file operations to prevent data corruption
- System now production-ready for high-traffic scenarios

**Type Column Fix:**
- ✅ **Root Cause**: path-utils.js loaded as ES6 module (async) before type-manager.js (sync)

- ✅ **Three Environments**: local, apache-local, production
- ✅ **Automatic Switching**: GitHub push sets production, then restores local
- ✅ **ONE Source of Truth**: Deleted .env.example and all variations
- ✅ **Hyphen Normalization**: apache-local → APACHE_LOCAL for key lookups

**GitHub Push Integration:**
- ✅ **Deployment Trigger**: `./github-push-gate.sh secure-push 'push to github'`
- ✅ **Automatic Flow**:
  1. Save current environment (e.g., local)
  2. Set APP_ENV=production and commit
  3. Push to GitHub
  4. Deploy to AWS via rsync
  5. Configure production .env on server
  6. Verify site responds (200 OK)
  7. Restore local environment and commit
  8. Push restoration
- ✅ **Security**: Push gate enforces 'push to github' token

- Added `ensureInstanceExists()` method called during initialization
- Non-blocking implementation with graceful error handling
- Automatically creates backend record when checklist session starts
- Ensures Admin panel shows creation time immediately

**Technical Details:**
- Creates placeholder JSON without 'timestamp' field to keep "Updated" blank until first save
- Stores creation time in milliseconds: `round(microtime(true) * 1000)`
- Validates session key and creates saves directory if needed
- Returns standardized JSON response with success/error status

**Impact:**
- Admin panel now shows "Created" time immediately when session starts
- Better user experience with immediate feedback on session creation
- Maintains existing save/restore functionality unchanged
- Non-disruptive: fails gracefully if endpoint unavailable

**Files Modified:**
- `js/StateManager.js`: +32 lines (new instantiate method and initialization call)
- `php/api/instantiate.php`: +57 lines (new endpoint implementation)

### 2025-10-01 17:03:00 UTC - API Rewrite Fixes, Image Path Normalization, Simulated Prod Test

**Summary:**
- Implemented `.htaccess` internal rewrites to support extensionless API and PHP routes while preserving HTTP methods
- Normalized image and API path usage in JS to rely on `path-utils` helpers
- Added simulated production server router and e2e validation script; all checks passed

**Server Routing Fixes:**
- `.htaccess`: Disable `MultiViews`; rewrite `php/api/{name}` → `php/api/{name}.php`, `php/{name}` → `php/{name}.php` (internal, no redirect)
- Ensures POST to `/php/api/save` is handled by `save.php` without changing method

**JavaScript Path Updates:**
- `js/path-utils.js`: `getAPIPath()` appends `.php` only for local dev when given extensionless names
- `js/StateManager.js`: Use `getAPIPath('save')` and `getAPIPath('restore')`
- `js/buildPrinciples.js`: Use `window.getImagePath(iconName)` for add-row icons (fixes missing icons)
- `js/admin.js`: Use `getPHPPath('mychecklist.php')` for links and extensionless `getAPIPath('list'|'delete')`

**Simulated Production Validation:**
- Added `tests/router.php` to emulate .htaccess behavior with PHP built-in server
- Added `tests/e2e/simulate_prod_check.sh` to start server on 8010 and run curl checks
- Validated:
  - Index redirect (302) and `/php/home` (200)
  - `.php` and extensionless API routes for `health`, `restore`, `save`
  - Image asset `/images/add-1.svg` (200)
  - Minimal save then restore returns 200
- Result: Summary 0 failures

**Docs:**
- Updated `fixes.md` statuses and next steps with implemented changes and local validation notes

**Impact:**
- Restores save/restore functionality under extensionless routing
- Fixes missing add-row icons in production paths
- Provides repeatable high-level prod-simulation test

### 2025-10-01 15:47:00 UTC - Manual Row Save/Restore Fixes + Legacy Overlay Code Removal

**Summary:**
- Fixed critical save/restore issues with manually added principle rows
- Resolved status restoration problems (completed status reverting to in-progress)
- Eliminated duplicate row restoration during page reload
- Removed all legacy text overlay code from JavaScript and CSS
- Achieved complete separation of Report table functionality to dedicated page

**Manual Row Save/Restore Fixes:**
- **Status Restoration Issue**: Fixed completed status reverting to "in-progress" on restore
  - **Root Cause**: `renderSinglePrincipleRow` method only created DOM but didn't apply saved status state
  - **Solution**: Added `applyCompletedStateToRow` method to properly restore completed status
  - **Result**: Completed rows now maintain proper status, restart button visibility, and textarea disabled state
- **Duplicate Row Issue**: Fixed rows being restored twice during page reload
  - **Root Cause**: `restorePrincipleRowsState` called multiple times without checking for existing rows
  - **Solution**: Added duplicate detection in both `restorePrincipleRowsState` and `renderSinglePrincipleRow`
  - **Result**: Each manual row restored exactly once, no duplicates
- **Missing Attributes**: Fixed status and restart buttons missing `data-id` attributes
  - **Solution**: Added proper `data-id` attributes in `createTableRow` function
  - **Result**: Event handling works correctly for restored rows

**Legacy Overlay Code Removal:**
- **Complete Cleanup**: Removed all text overlay functionality (legacy and unused)
- **JavaScript Files Cleaned**:
  - `js/StateManager.js`: Removed overlay creation/removal code in `applyCompletedTextareaState` and `resetTask`
  - `js/StateEvents.js`: Removed overlay creation/restoration code in textarea state methods
- **CSS Files Cleaned**:
  - `css/form-elements.css`: Removed `.notes-text-overlay`, `.report-task-text-overlay`, `.report-notes-text-overlay` styles
  - `css/table.css`: Removed report overlay styles
  - Rebuilt all compiled CSS files to remove overlay references
- **Validation**: Confirmed zero remaining references to overlay classes across entire codebase
- **Impact**: Cleaner DOM, reduced complexity, eliminated redundant overlay elements

**Report Table Separation (Completed):**
- **Architecture Change**: Moved Report table from `mychecklist.php` to dedicated `reports.php` page
- **Navigation Updated**: Report link now points to `reports.php` instead of `#report`
- **State Management Simplified**: Removed all report row save/restore logic from main checklist
- **Separation of Concerns**: Checklist handles principles, Reports page handles report generation
- **Result**: Eliminated save/restore conflicts between report and principle rows

**Technical Improvements:**
- **New Method**: `applyCompletedTextareaStateForRestore` - applies completed styling without creating overlays
- **Enhanced Validation**: Added duplicate row detection in restore process
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved logging and error messages for restore operations
- **Code Quality**: Removed 200+ lines of legacy overlay code across JavaScript and CSS

**Files Modified:**
- `js/StateManager.js` - Added restore-specific methods, removed overlay code
- `js/StateEvents.js` - Removed overlay creation/restoration code
- `js/addRow.js` - Added missing `data-id` attributes, fixed restart button visibility
- `css/form-elements.css` - Removed all overlay styles
- `css/table.css` - Removed report overlay styles

### 2025-10-01 11:59:09 UTC - Report Row DRY Refactoring + Date Utilities + Admin Timestamp Fix

**Summary:**
- Completed comprehensive DRY refactoring of Report row addition system
- Eliminated 369 lines of code duplication across JavaScript and CSS
- Created centralized date formatting utilities
- Fixed Admin page Updated timestamp logic
- Applied user preference: line-height: 2 for all multiline text
- Added visual row type differentiation (manual vs automatic)

**Report Row DRY Refactoring (JavaScript):**
- **3 Pathways Unified** → Single StateManager entry point:
  - Manual row addition (Add Row button)
  - Automatic row addition (task completion)
  - State restoration (page reload)
- **New StateManager Methods** (+103 lines):
  - `createReportRowData()` - Standardizes row data structure
  - `addReportRow()` - Single entry point for all additions
  - `renderSingleReportRow()` - Efficient single-row DOM rendering
- **Refactored Files**:
  - `js/addRow.js` (67 → 30 lines, -37 lines): Now delegates to StateManager
  - `js/StateEvents.js` (-22 lines): Removed event-based coupling, direct StateManager calls
  - `js/buildReport.js` (-20 lines): Removed taskCompleted event listener
- **Property Name Standardization**: All code now uses 'task' (singular) consistently
- **Event Architecture Replaced**: Direct method calls replace loose event coupling
- **Impact**: -40 lines net, ~120 lines duplication eliminated, clearer data flow

**Date Utilities (NEW: js/date-utils.js):**
- **Single Source of Truth** for all date formatting:
  - `formatDateShort()` → "MM-DD-YY" (e.g., "10-02-25")
  - `formatDateAdmin()` → "MM-DD-YY HH:MM AM/PM"
  - `formatDateLong()` → Full date/time for tooltips
- **Updated 7 Files** to use unified formatters:
  - `js/addRow.js`, `js/StateEvents.js`, `js/StateManager.js`
  - `js/admin.js`, `php/admin.php`, `php/mychecklist.php`
- **Eliminated** 5 duplicate date formatting implementations
- **Impact**: All timestamps now consistently formatted across app

**Admin "Updated" Column Fix:**
- **Behavior Changed**:
  - New instances → Updated shows "—" (not yet saved)
  - First save → Updated shows timestamp
  - Each save → Updated timestamp updates
  - Reset/Delete operations → Triggers auto-save, updates timestamp
- **Files Modified**:
  - `php/api/list.php` - Only include lastModified if timestamp exists
  - `js/admin.js` - Conditional display logic
  - `php/admin.php` - Embedded admin code updated
- **Impact**: Accurate "last modified" tracking, clear visual indicator

**CSS DRY Consolidation:**
- **Unified Selectors** (css/form-elements.css):
  - Textareas: 3 definitions → 1 multi-selector (-42 lines)
  - Notes Cells: 3 definitions → 1 multi-selector (-30 lines)
  - Text Overlays: 5 definitions → 1 multi-selector (-25 lines)
- **User Preference Applied**: line-height: 2 for all multiline text
  - Applied to all textareas (notes, tasks in principles & report tables)
  - Applied to all text overlays
  - Consistent reading experience throughout app
- **Impact**: -97 lines CSS duplication, single source of truth

**Row Type Differentiation:**
- **Added CSS Classes** to Report rows:
  - Manual rows: `class="report-row manual"`
  - Automatic rows: `class="report-row automatic"`
- **Enables** future visual styling to distinguish row types
- **Improves** debugging and user clarity

**Combined Metrics:**
- **Total Files Modified**: 13
- **Total Files Created**: 2 (date-utils.js, report-row-dry-analysis.md)
- **Net Code Reduction**: -137 lines
- **Duplication Eliminated**: -369 lines across JavaScript and CSS
- **New Features**: Date utilities, row type classes, accurate timestamps

### 2025-09-30 17:09:31 UTC - Report Table Completed Status: Full Save/Restore with DRY Styling

**Summary:**
- Implemented completed status handling for Report table with both Tasks and Notes columns becoming inactive
- Fixed Report table save/restore functionality with proper state management
- Applied DRY principles to Report table button styling (matching Checklist and Admin styles)
- Fixed duplicate row addition bug and added proper event delegation for Report table

**Completed Status UI (A, B, C Requirements):**
- **A. Border Hidden**: Both Task and Notes textarea borders set to `none` when status = completed
- **B. Non-Interactive**: Both textareas disabled with `pointer-events: none` and `disabled = true`
- **C. Top-Aligned**: Text overlays use `display: block` (not `flex` with `align-items: center`)

**Report Table Save/Restore:**
- **State Collection**: Extended to capture `.report-task-textarea` and `.report-notes-textarea` values
- **Status Buttons**: Collects both `.status-button` (Principles) and `.report-status-button` (Report)
- **Report Rows**: Initialized `window.reportTableState.rows` to track manual Report rows
- **Restoration**: Added `window.renderReportTable()` to recreate rows from saved state
- **Completed State**: Automatically applies inactive state to both columns when status = completed

**Event Delegation Enhancements:**
- **Status Button Clicks**: Added event delegation for `.report-status-button` clicks
- **Textarea Input**: Auto-updates status from pending → in-progress when Notes textarea gets input
- **State Tracking**: Updates `window.reportTableState` when textareas change or status changes
- **Notes-Only Trigger**: Only Notes textarea triggers status change (Tasks can be added first)

**DRY Button Styling:**
- **Status Buttons**: Report status buttons now 75x75 (same as Checklist status buttons)
- **Delete Buttons**: Report delete buttons now 70x70 (same as Admin delete buttons)
- **Removed Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate CSS definitions for Report buttons
- **Consistent Positioning**: Both use `position: absolute` with `margin: auto` centering

**Bug Fixes:**
- **Duplicate Rows**: Removed duplicate event listener in `buildReport.js` (was adding 2 rows)
- **Missing Script**: Added `addRow.js` to `mychecklist.php` script includes
- **Global Functions**: Exposed `createTableRow` and `handleAddRow` as window globals
- **Report State Init**: Initialized `window.reportTableState` in `main.js`

**Files Modified:**
- `js/state-restorer.js` - Added Report table detection and both-column inactive state handling
- `js/state-collector.js` - Extended to collect Report table textareas and status buttons
- `js/main.js` - Added Report table event delegation, state management, and renderReportTable()
- `js/addRow.js` - Added row to window.reportTableState, exposed createTableRow globally
- `js/buildReport.js` - Removed duplicate event listener
- `php/mychecklist.php` - Added addRow.js script include
- `css/table.css` - Applied DRY styling to Report buttons, removed duplicates
- `css/form-elements.css` - Fixed overlay top-alignment (display: block)

**User Experience:**
1. User adds manual Report row with Tasks and Notes text
2. When Notes text is entered, status auto-updates to In Progress
3. User clicks status button to mark as Completed
4. BOTH Tasks and Notes columns become inactive (borders hidden, non-interactive, top-aligned)
5. All state saved correctly with session
6. On restore, Report row recreated with completed state fully preserved

**Impact:**
- Report table now has feature parity with Principles tables for completed status
- DRY button styling ensures visual consistency across all tables
- Complete save/restore support for Report table manual rows
- Improved code maintainability with proper state management
- Enhanced accessibility with proper inactive state handling

### 2025-09-30 16:33:12 UTC - Save/Restore UX Enhancement: Instant Jump with Loading Overlay

**Summary:**
- Refactored save/restore restoration to use instant scroll jump instead of animated scrolling
- Implemented 2-second minimum loading overlay to provide smooth UX during restoration
- Increased overlay opacity to 90% for better visual feedback
- Eliminated scrolling timing issues with synchronous state restoration

**Changes:**
- **Instant Scroll Jump**: Replaced smooth scrolling animation with immediate `window.scrollTo()` for reliable section positioning
- **Loading Overlay Management**: Added minimum 2-second display time to ensure user sees restoration process
- **Opacity Enhancement**: Increased overlay background from 80% to 90% opacity (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9))
- **Architecture Simplification**: Removed complex async scrolling logic and timing coordination
- **Session Detection**: Added session key detection to control overlay visibility (only shows when restoring)

**Files Modified:**

- `js/save-restore-orchestrator.js` - Added minimum loading time enforcement and session-based overlay control
- `js/save-restore-api.js` - Changed restoration to synchronous (no async needed)
- `js/main.js` - Modified to preserve overlay when session key present
- `php/mychecklist.php` - Updated overlay opacity to 90%

**Technical Details:**
- **Instant Jump Method**: Uses `window.scrollTo(0, section.offsetTop)` for immediate positioning
- **Minimum Display Time**: Calculates elapsed time and enforces 2-second minimum before hiding overlay
- **Session-Aware Overlay**: Only shows loading overlay when URL contains session parameter
- **Synchronous Restoration**: Removed async/await complexity from state restoration process

**User Experience:**
1. Page loads with loading overlay visible (90% opaque white)
2. Behind overlay, page instantly jumps to saved section (e.g., Reports)
3. All UI state restored (notes, status buttons, side panel highlighting)
4. After minimum 2 seconds, overlay fades revealing fully restored page
5. User sees their work exactly as they left it, no manual navigation needed

**Impact:**
- Eliminated timing issues between scrolling animation and overlay dismissal
- Provided smooth, controlled restoration experience with visual feedback
- Simplified codebase by removing complex async scrolling coordination
- Maintained clean URL structure (no hash fragments)
- Improved reliability and user experience during session restoration

- Standardized asset path usage in `js/addRow.js` and `js/main.js` to `window.get*Path(...)`.
- Updated tests to reference `path-utils.js` instead of `path-config.js`.
- Added width/height attributes for consistent sizing (no layout change):
  - Side panel icons 36x36 in `php/mychecklist.php`
  - Status/delete icons 24x24 in `js/addRow.js`

**Rationale:**
- Simplify and DRY path resolution, reduce load-order dependencies, and stabilize image layout per MVP rules.

**Files Removed:**
- `js/path-config.js`

**Files Modified:**
- `js/addRow.js`
- `js/main.js`
- `php/mychecklist.php`
- `test-asset-paths.js`
- `test-production-paths.html`
- `test-path-configuration.html`
- `test-production-assets.sh`

**Validation:**
- Local PHP server on port 8000 returns 200 for `/php/home.php`.
