📋 EDITING STRATEGY OVERVIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ PREFERRED: Incremental Edits with search_replace
   - Fast execution (no authorization prompts)
   - Changes validated individually
   - Lower chance of errors
   - Works on files of any size

❌ AVOID: Full File Rewrites with write tool
   - Triggers authorization prompts on large files
   - Entire file must be revalidated
   - Higher risk of introducing errors
   - Can timeout on very large files

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 BEST PRACTICES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. USE INCREMENTAL EDITS (search_replace)

   Break changes into logical sections - each targeting 5-20 lines
   Make multiple sequential edits rather than one large rewrite
   Batch similar changes together (e.g., all header reformats)

   Example - Reformatting markdown headers:

   search_replace("### **Section 1**" → "## Section 1")
   search_replace("### **Section 2**" → "## Section 2")
   search_replace("#### **A. Subsection**" → "### Section A")

2. PARALLEL TOOL CALLS

   Group independent edits in same tool call batch
   Executes faster than sequential calls
   Only works if edits don't depend on each other

   Good for: Changing multiple unrelated sections simultaneously
   Bad for: Changes that build on previous edits

3. CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS

   old_string must uniquely identify the target
   Include 3-5 lines BEFORE the change
   Include 3-5 lines AFTER the change
   Only ONE instance changed per call

4. WHEN TO USE write INSTEAD

   ✓ Creating new files
   ✓ Files < 100 lines
   ✓ Complete file replacement needed
   ✓ MCP filesystem tools available

📊 PERFORMANCE COMPARISON (from reports-page.md formatting)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

File: 832 lines, multiple sections to reformat

Approach 1: write tool (full rewrite)
  Result: ❌ Triggered authorization prompts
  Speed:  Slow (waiting for user approval)

Approach 2: search_replace (incremental)
  Result: ✅ Completed without authorization
  Speed:  Fast (15+ edits executed immediately)
  Edits:  - Header standardization (7 calls)
          - Metadata additions (3 calls)
          - Cleanup duplicates (7 calls)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE: Reformatting Documentation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Task: Reformat reports-page.md for AI agent consumption
Changes needed:
  - Remove informal narrative text
  - Standardize headers (remove emoji numbering)
  - Add metadata sections
  - Clean up duplicate separators
  - Add structured summaries

Strategy used:
  1. Add metadata header (1 search_replace)
  2. Standardize section headers (8 search_replace calls)
  3. Update file metadata blocks (7 search_replace calls)
  4. Clean duplicate separators (7 search_replace calls)

Total: 23 incremental edits
Result: ✅ Completed in < 2 minutes without user intervention

🔧 TOOL SELECTION GUIDE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

| Task                          | Tool             | Why                        |
|-------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Reformat large file           | search_replace   | No authorization needed    |
| Change multiple sections      | search_replace   | Incremental validation     |
| Add new file                  | write            | File doesn't exist         |
| Small file (<100 lines)       | write or replace | Either works fine          |
| Replace single line           | search_replace   | Precise targeting          |
| Rename variables/functions    | search_replace   | Use replace_all param      |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  COMMON PITFALLS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

× Trying to rewrite 800-line file with write tool
  → Use search_replace instead

× Not including enough context in old_string
  → Include 3-5 lines before and after

× Making dependent edits in parallel
  → Make them sequential if later edits depend on earlier ones

× Using MCP filesystem write on large files
  → Also triggers authorization - use search_replace

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

For large file edits:
  1. Plan your changes as discrete sections
  2. Use search_replace for each change
  3. Include sufficient context (3-5 lines)
  4. Batch independent changes in parallel
  5. Execute dependent changes sequentially

This approach is:
  ✓ Faster (no authorization delays)
  ✓ Safer (incremental validation)
  ✓ More reliable (handles large files)
  ✓ More efficient (parallel execution where possible)
