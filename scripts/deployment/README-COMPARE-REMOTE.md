# Compare Local Files with Remote Deployment

**Script:** `compare-with-remote.sh`
**Purpose:** Compare local working directory with remote deployment (staging or live)
**Method:** rsync dry-run with itemize-changes

---

## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Pre-Deployment Validation** - See what will change before deploying
2. **Staging Comparison** - Compare local with accessilist2 before going live
3. **Live Comparison** - Verify what's different from current production
4. **Change Tracking** - Audit deployment history

---

## üìã Usage

### Basic Comparison (Summary Only)

```bash
# Compare with staging (accessilist2) - DEFAULT
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh

# Or explicitly
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging

# Compare with live production (accessilist)
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh live
```

### Detailed Comparison (With File Diffs)

```bash
# Show detailed diffs for changed files (staging)
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging --detailed

# Show detailed diffs for changed files (live)
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh live --detailed
```

---

## üìä Output Explanation

### Rsync Item Codes

The script uses rsync's `--itemize-changes` flag. Here's what the codes mean:

```
>f+++++++++ file.php    # New file (doesn't exist on remote)
>f.st...... file.php    # Modified (size or timestamp changed)
>f......... file.php    # Unchanged
```

**Common patterns:**
- `>f+++` - **New file** (will be created)
- `>f.st` - **Updated file** (size/time changed)
- `>f...` - **Unchanged** (identical)

### Summary Output

```

Environment: staging (/var/websites/.../accessilist2/)
Total Files: 89 (deployment whitelist)
Unchanged:   75
Updated:     12
New:         2

‚ö†Ô∏è  14 files will be changed on deployment
```

### Detailed Diff Output (--detailed flag)

Shows line-by-line diffs for modified files:

```

## üîç Example Workflows

### Scenario 1: Pre-Deployment Check

```bash
# Check what will change before deploying to staging
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging

# Output shows:
# - 12 files will be updated
# - 2 new files
# - 75 unchanged

# Review changes, then deploy
./scripts/deployment/upload-to-test-directory.sh
```

### Scenario 2: Detailed Review

```bash
# Get detailed diffs to review exact changes
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging --detailed

# Reviews each changed file with diff
# Decide if changes are safe to deploy
```

### Scenario 3: Live Production Comparison

```bash
# Compare current work with live production
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh live

# See how far ahead local development is
# Plan deployment strategy
```

### Scenario 4: Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# After deploying to staging, verify sync
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging

# Should show:
# Unchanged: 89
# Updated: 0
# New: 0
# ‚úÖ All files in sync!
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Override defaults
export DEPLOY_USER="your-username"
export DEPLOY_HOST="your-server.com"
export SSH_KEY="~/.ssh/your-key.pem"

# Run comparison
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging
```

### Defaults

- **User:** george
- **Host:** ec2-3-20-59-76.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
- **SSH Key:** ~/.ssh/GeorgeWebAIMServerKey.pem
- **Staging Path:** /var/websites/webaim/htdocs/training/online/accessilist2/

## üîí Security Notes

### What's Compared

‚úÖ **ONLY the 89 production files** (from deployment whitelist)
- Same list as `upload-production-files.sh`
- No sensitive files (config.json, .env, .git excluded)

### What's NOT Compared

‚ùå Development files (node_modules/, tests/, scripts/, docs/)
‚ùå Sensitive configuration (config.json, .env)
‚ùå Git repository (.git/)
‚ùå Any files outside the deployment whitelist

### SSH Access

- Uses same SSH key as deployment scripts
- Read-only operations (dry-run mode)
- No files modified on server
- Safe to run anytime

---

## üìà Benefits

### Before This Script

‚ùå No way to preview deployment changes
‚ùå Had to deploy blind or manually check each file
‚ùå Risk of unexpected changes on server
‚ùå No audit trail of what changed

### With This Script

‚úÖ **Preview changes before deployment**
‚úÖ **Audit what will be updated**
‚úÖ **Detailed diffs available on demand**
‚úÖ **Safe (read-only, dry-run mode)**
‚úÖ **Fast** (~10 seconds for summary, ~1 min for detailed)
‚úÖ **Accurate** (uses same file list as deployment)

## üß™ Testing the Script

### Test 1: Basic Comparison

```bash
# Run comparison with staging
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging

# Expected output:
# - Connection successful
# - File list created (89 files)
# - Comparison complete
# - Summary showing unchanged/updated/new counts
```

### Test 2: Detailed Diff

```bash
# Get detailed diffs
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging --detailed

# Expected output:
# - Same as above
# - Plus: Line-by-line diffs for each changed file
```

### Test 3: Live Comparison

```bash
# Compare with live production (careful!)
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh live

# Shows how far ahead local is from production
```

---

## üîÑ Integration with Deployment Workflow

### Recommended Pre-Deployment Flow

```bash
# 1. Compare with staging
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging

# 2. Review changes shown

# 3. If changes look good, deploy to staging
./scripts/deployment/upload-to-test-directory.sh

# 4. Verify sync
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging
# Should show: 0 updated, 0 new (all in sync)

# 5. Test staging
external-test-production

# 6. Compare with live
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh live

# 7. Deploy to live
./scripts/deployment/upload-production-files.sh

# 8. Verify live sync
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh live
# Should show: 0 updated, 0 new
```

---

## üí° Advanced Usage

### Compare Specific Environment

```bash
# Staging (default)
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh

# Live production
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh live
```

### Get Detailed Diffs

```bash
# Summary only (fast)
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging

# With diffs (slower, more detail)
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging --detailed
```

### Save Comparison Report

```bash
# Save to file for review
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging > comparison-report.txt

# Or with detailed diffs
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging --detailed > detailed-comparison.txt
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### When to Run

1. **Before deploying to staging** - Preview changes
2. **Before deploying to live** - Ensure staging tested all changes
3. **After deployment** - Verify sync
4. **When troubleshooting** - See if local and remote match

### Interpreting Results

**All files unchanged (0 updated, 0 new):**
- ‚úÖ Local and remote are in sync
- ‚úÖ Safe to skip deployment (no changes)

**Few files updated (1-5):**
- ‚úÖ Normal development iteration
- ‚úÖ Review changes, then deploy

**Many files updated (10+):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Major changes - review carefully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider detailed diff review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test thoroughly on staging first

**Many new files (5+):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Significant additions - verify intentional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Check deployment whitelist is up to date

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "SSH key not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
export SSH_KEY="$HOME/.ssh/YourKey.pem"
./scripts/deployment/compare-with-remote.sh staging
```

### "Permission denied"

**Solution:** Verify SSH key has correct permissions
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/GeorgeWebAIMServerKey.pem
```

### "Connection refused"

**Solution:** Check SSH connection
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/GeorgeWebAIMServerKey.pem george@ec2-...
```

### Rsync shows many changes unexpectedly

**Possible causes:**
1. Line ending differences (CRLF vs LF)
2. Permissions changed
3. Files edited directly on server (not via deployment)

**Solution:** Review with `--detailed` flag to see actual differences
